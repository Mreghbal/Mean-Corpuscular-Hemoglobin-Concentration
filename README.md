## Introduction
Welcome to the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) Calculator! This calculator is a Python script that calculates the MCHC value based on the provided hemoglobin and hematocrit values. The MCHC is an important parameter used in the evaluation of red blood cells and can provide insights into various medical conditions.

## Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)
The Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) is a measure of the average concentration hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cells. It is expressed as a percentage and represents the amount hemoglobin relative to the volume of red blood cells. MCHC is commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of various blood disorders, such as anemia.

The formula to calculate MCHC is as follows:

``MCHC = (hemoglobin / hematocrit) * 100
```

where- `hemoglobin` is the amount of hemoglobin in grams.
- `hematocrit` is the fraction red blood cells in the total blood volume.

## Usage
To use this MCHC calculator, you need to provide the values for `hemoglobin` and `hematocrit`. The calculator will then compute the MCHC value using the provided formula.

Here's an example usage:

```python
hemoglobin_level = 15.2
hematoc_value = 42.5

mchc_result = calculate_mchc(hemoglobin_level, hematocrit_value)
print("Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC):", mchc_result)
```

The output will be:

``Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): <calculated MCHC value>
```

## How to Run
To run the MCHC calculator, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `calculate_mchc.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `calculate_mchc.py` file is located.
4. Run the following command to execute the script:

   ```bash
   python calculate_mchc.py
   ```

5. Follow the instructions in the script and provide the required input values when prompted.
6. The calculated MCHC value will displayed as output.
