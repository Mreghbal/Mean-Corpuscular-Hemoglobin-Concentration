# Mean-Corpuscular-Hemoglobin-Concentration
Python code that calculates the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) in actual condition.
In this code, the calculate_mchc function takes two arguments: hemoglobin and hematocrit. It divides the hemoglobin value by the hematocrit value and then multiplies it by 100 to get the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC). The calculated MCHC value is then returned by the function.

In the example usage section, I've provided sample values for hemoglobin_level and hematocrit_value, and called the calculate_mchc function with these values. The calculated MCHC value is then printed as output.

Note: This code assumes that the input values are provided in the correct units (grams and fraction respectively) and the formula used to calculate MCHC is appropriate for your actual condition.
